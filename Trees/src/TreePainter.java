/*
 * TreePainter.java
 *
 *Steven Moskovchenko
 *Winston Churchill High School
 *December 4, 2003
 *Period 2 APCS, Ms. Steelman
 *
 *
 *A program to draw visual representations of binary trees.
 *
 *
 *	To use:
 *
 *1. Create a new TreePainter first:
 *   TreePainter painter = new TreePainter();
 *
 *
 *2. Give it the tree:
 *   painter.setTree(myRootNode);	
 *
 * Or you can just pass in the root of the tree you
 * what to draw:
 *
 *   TreePainter painter = new TreePainter(myRootNode);
 *
 *
 *3. If you modify the tree, refresh the image:
 *	 painter.repaint();
 *
 *It does this using 4 classes:
 *  A TreePainter class to create the window and work the graphics
 *    A BSTNode class to actually make the tree
 *     (you have to make the tree yourself, of course)
 *    A NodeInfo class to store temporary information about each
 *        node's position and size.
 *    A TreeDrawCanvas class (Extends the Canvas class) to perform
 *        graphical operations
 *
 *
 *    The BSTNode class is in a separate Java file
 *    The other three classes are in this file.
 *
 *
 * * Created on November 25, 2003, 8:52 AM
 *
 *
 * Files that are included:
 *  BSTNode.java - the binary tree node class by Ms. Steelman
 *  TreePainter.java    - this file
 *  TreePainter.form    - a NetBeans file of the GUI for this program
 *  TreeTest.java       - a simple demonstration
 *  TreeTest.mcp        - a CodeWarrior project for this demonstration
 *
 *
 *  The GUI init section of the TreePainter class was made with
 *  Sun's NetBeans. If you want to edit the GUI, it would 
 *  probably be easier to open the files with NetBeans than to
 *  modify it by hand. But hey, whatever you want to do.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * And of course the obligatory license statement.
 * ("A license a day keeps the lawyers away")
 *
 * You can do whatever you want with this thing as long as you
 * don't charge people money for it. If you change something
 * big, please be nice to people and leave a comment noting
 * the changes. 
 *
 * Made (for the most part) in LINUX. Go open source software.
 *
 *
 *
 * Changelog:
 *
 * -- 1/12/2004
 *     - Added check for node.getValue() == null in case a node
 *	     itself is not null but its value is.
 *	   - Removed some nonsense comments that sometimes caused
 *       CodeWarrior to spit out meaningless errors.
 *
